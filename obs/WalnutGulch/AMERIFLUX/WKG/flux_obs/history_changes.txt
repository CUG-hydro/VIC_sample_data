April 10, 2007
--------------

The initial Level 1 files provided by Russ Scott for the Kendall Grassland
site (US-Wkg) were posted.


March 27, 2008
--------------

The L1, L2, L3, and L4 files previously available for Kendall Grasslands
were removed since Russ Scott provided new files in March 2008.  The new
files, spanning 2004 to 2007, include corrections to longwave and net
radiation fluxes.


September 2, 2008
-----------------

The finalized L2 files (Version 2) produced by CDIAC resulting from
files provided by Russ Scott in March 2008 have been posted.  The new L2s
include 2007 data and corrections to longwave and net radiation fluxes.
New L3 and L4 files will be generated by Dario Papale (CarboEurope)
and available soon.


October 12, 2008
----------------

Version 2 of the L3 and L4 files produced by Dario Papale for the US-Wkg
site have been posted.


March 25, 2010
--------------

Russ Scott provided new files (third iteration or Version 3) for the
US-Wkg site and these new files replace all previous Level 1 files.
The new files contain data through 2009 and the following changes to
the previous 2004-07 data.

1. Some (small) corrections to the way that that Fc was being computed

2. Ground heat flux-corrected bulk density to revise change in
storage component to the flux

3. (for 2005-2007 only) undid corrections to the longwave
components of Rn. Subsequent comparisons with a nearby, independent site
revealed that these corrections were unwarranted.


April 14, 2010
--------------

Version 3 of the L2 files for the Kendall Grassland site were posted and
contain data through 2009.  These files replace all previous versions and
contain the changes mentioned above for 3/25/2010.  


March 28, 2011
--------------

Version 4 of the Level 2 files for the US-Wkg site were posted and contain
data through 2010.  Data before 2010 did not change from Version 3.



January 4, 2013
---------------

Version 5 (V005) of the Level 2 files for the Kendall Grassland site was
posted and provides data through 2011.  Several corrections to data from
earlier years are included in the latest version.  Specifically, for 2005
through 2010 the flux terms (Fc, LE, and H) were re-processed to include
frequency response corrections.  PAR values for the period 2007 to 2010
were re-calculated using a new calibration coefficient and soil heat
flux data for 2005 through 2008 were re-processed for spike filtering.

April 10, 2013
--------------

Version 6 (V006) of the Level 2 (L2) files for US-Wkg was posted and
provides data through 2012.  Data before 2012 did not change from V005.
Details about the processing of the original files submitted by Russ
Scott by CDIAC to produce the standardized V006 L2 files are provided at
